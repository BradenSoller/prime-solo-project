Young Buck Services 

 -Developed a web app for my friend's service company. This website allows users to login and set up appointments, and learn more about YoungBuck and what they have to offer. It also has the ability for the client to view all the appointments where itâ€™s sorted by pending appointments and confirmed appointments, making it easy for the client to differentiate the two.
 
- Technologies used for YoungBuck Services: JavaScript, React, Node, PostgreSQL, Redux, Saga, Express and styling programs such as MUI, and CSS.
